# I saw 11. The smallest possible number wouyld have been 5 and the largest would be 20

# What did you see on line 2?
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# Could line 2 have produced a 4?
# Saw 5. smallest would be 3 and largest would be 9. 4 is impossible

# # What did you see on line 3?
# # What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# I saw 3.74...,  The smallest number would be 2.0 and the largest would be just below 5.5
