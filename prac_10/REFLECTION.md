# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

It was varied. Sometimes accurate, sometimes it was way off especially when taking longer than expected.

...

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
When I started out, it was difficult to get a fairly accurate estimate. I ended up taking much longer than I would expect.
With time, my coding speed has increased and so has my ability to estimate how long a particular problem would take to 
solve.

...

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?
It's a great way to measure your growth in the subject. Not so much so, the estimates but the
tracking of time it takes you to complete a piece of code. As you start solving redundant problems quicker
and quicker you actually get more motivated as the practice I've been doing is showing results.

...

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Truthfully, not much. All  the code reviews I received, which were less than half of my requests,
ended up being generic statements such as "nice code" or "good job". The idea was excellent
but its execution was flawed

...

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?
I did not do any code reviews as no request was made of me by any student> I would have loved to compare my way of writing
code against other students as I feel that this would be a great way of possibly learning from others
since there are so many ways of solving the same code.
...

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
I would make the code reviews optional only for those interested. If not done correctly, by people who
only do it for the sake of finishing, it fails to serve its purpose.

...

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
The actual coding and use of GitHub. I did a good job of writing working code and committing
and pushing my progress to my online repo.
